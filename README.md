<h1>Responsive-Portfolio</h1>
<p>This is a repository containing a simple portfolio website to complete an assignment for the Penn LPS coding bootcamp. The assignment was to use a previous assignment and make the layout responsive using media queries. The media queries are set at max-widths of @980px, @768px, and @640px. </p>
<p> I also completed the bonus assignment of adding CSS animations to the pages in the website. If you watch the footer when you load or reload any of the pages, you will see it expland and then contract back down to its initial size. Also, if you hover over any of the pictures on the portfolio page you will see an animation to make them tilt about 10 degrees and then stay that way until you remove the hover and the snap back to normal.</p>
